# Thousand-miles

On a lockdown walk I got the song 'A Thousand Miles' by Vanessa Carlton stuck
in my head. It's a great song.

This repo is the build for a website hosted on an AWS EC2 machine,
accessible on my website: thousandmiles.sebstrug.com.

The aim was to make my friends laugh! I hope it makes you chuckle too.

I've noted some [issues](https://github.com/SebStrug/thousand-miles/issues) with the code. I don't plan to fix them but the website will remain hosted for now.
